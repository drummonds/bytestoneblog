      <description>Tartan or checked weaving pattern has ancient origins. Perhaps it came with the spread of the ancient Bronze age Celts from Austria and Turkey. To the East there may be a link to the Tarim Mummies as was popularised by Elizabeth Barber1. This currently has got caught up in origin stories of the Han. Notable mummies are the tall, red-haired &amp;ldquo;Chärchän man&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Ur-David&amp;rdquo; (1000 BCE); who wore a red twill tunic and tartan leggings.</description>
