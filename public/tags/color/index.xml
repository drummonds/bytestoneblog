      <description>Standards I used to have a Greta Mcbeth colour calibration both small and large but lost the large one and only have the small one left. Just recently purchased the Datacolor SpyderCheckr| 24 but probably should have bought the| 48 patch version in a hard shell. I have just discovered that| 24 patch is the right side of the| 48 patch. So can use the calibration data from that for checking the DataColour Print.</description>
