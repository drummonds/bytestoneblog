    <h1 id="bank-reconciliation">Bank reconciliation</h1>
<h2 id="old-year-unreconciled-account">Old year unreconciled account.</h2>
<p>Dealing with drummonds.net a couple of problems became apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>a duplicate unreconciled bank transaction had got into the final accounts</li>
<li>This helped but was not the only reason the bank reonciliation was close but not accurate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="non-material-difference">Non material difference</h2>
<p>The difference was small &lt; Â£100 so an opening year correction was done.  In addition the
prior year duplicate was reconciled and then corrected on the first day of the current year.</p>
<ol>
<li>The accounts were opened back to the duplicate entry</li>
<li>The duplicate entry was reconciled.</li>
<li>The accounts were closed again to the end of the year and verified that the closing
bank balance was not affected.</li>
<li>An adjustment entry was done on the first day of the year to correct the bank balance.
<ul>
<li>This can&rsquo;t be a straightforward manual journal as you are not allowed to use
the NC 100 for either side of the journal.</li>
<li>Put it in as a spend money transaction to code 960 Retained Earnings</li>
<li>Mark as reconciled</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Done!</p>
