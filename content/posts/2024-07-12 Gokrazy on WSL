# Technical issues

For testing I want to run gokrazy on my laptop for testing local development of gophoto.  This requires a framebuffer.  This becomes a more complicated question.  You can install QEMU which gokrazy supports on Windows but it is slow compared if it doesn't run at the hardware emulation layer.

You can also run QEMU in WSL Linux (I use Ubuntu).  The only snag with that is that you don't have a frame buffer.  So using the https://gokrazy.org/userguide/qemu/ I found you only need a little adaption (remove the KVM accelerator `-machine accel=kvm`):

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -smp 8 \
  -m 2048 \
  -drive file=virtual.img,format=raw \
  -nographic
```

This then booted up ok although not yet with the grokrazy web interface.  I am working on a train and it seems to have picked up an IP address from the onboard servers and so is not serving locally.
