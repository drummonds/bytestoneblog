### Bread loaf

Adapted from the back of Doves Freee recipe.

#### Ingredients

- 2 eggs (yolks and whites)
- 27g sugar eg coconut sugar or honey
- 5g salt
- 75g oil eg olive oil
- 5g vinegar
- 350ml liquid tepid water  I often use 150ml of milk and rest water
- 10g quick yeast
- 500g Doves Freee bread flour have at least 250g and can make up rest with dark rye/ oat flour

#### Method

- Mix all ingredients in bread pan except flour
- Use a beater for 1 minute to get all  incredients mixed up
- Add flour
- Use gluten free bread mix (Program 15 on my Panasonic SD-YR2540)
- After 5 mins need to get a paddle to mix in edges

##### Yolks

- Separate the egg yolks
- add the sugar and mix

##### Completion

- Put the mixer on for 75C and stir 1
- Drizzle the egg yolk mix in
- Keep stirring for 12 mins
- Wait till end and strain into container

This worked quite well although a little thin.  Wondering about slightly high temps.
