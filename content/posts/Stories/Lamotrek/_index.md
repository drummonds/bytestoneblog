This is a story about [Lamotrek atoll][] which was visited circa 2024 by my friends Jane and Graham.
On many Atolls life was quite grim as the looming effect of climate change was making the future
look bleak.  On Lamotrek there was a sense of purpose.  The island had long had a school of navigation
and this was still working.  With associated boat building and training in navigation skills.
in addition the island was run in a purposeful fashion.  Each day there would be meeting.  This was
run by the elders of the island.  Jobs for the day would be discussed and decided upon.  
They were then carried out.

This sense of purpose and routine had a great impact on the island life and environment.
