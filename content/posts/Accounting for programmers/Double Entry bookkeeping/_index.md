The Farolfi ledger displays the six essential features of double-entry bookkeeping as outlined by accounting historian G.A. Lee: 

first, the idea of a proprietor or business partnership as an accounting entity whose books record its financial relationships with others. 

Second, its entries are made in a single monetary unit so they can be added together. 

Third, it relates the following oppositions: increases and decreases in physical holdings of cash or goods; increases and decreases in debts by or to other individuals or entities; and increases and decreases in the business’s own assets and liabilities. 

Fourth, owner’s equity is shown as the sum of assets and liabilities. 

Fifth, profit is understood to be the net increase in the owner’s equity (and loss the net decrease). 

Sixth, the profit or loss is measured over a clearly defined accounting period.```
