This is an extended series of posts to introduce the concepts of accounting to programmers.  It is born of my own exploration into the subject and I have started writing in 2016.  It take a somewhat different approach to most books in that we will be looking at accounting
from the point of view of a programmer, me!

There two goals, in the first part I am exploring the nature of double entry book keeping with
the directed graph approach and how accounting emerges from this.  There is a lot of explanation and
exploration as to the nature of accounting records and why the credit/debit system is isomorphic
with positive and negative balances.

If you want to just read one thing then try the [explanation of an orange trading business](/afp/movements/orangesasmoney).

The use of computers allows a freedom to present information in different ways to those bound by
clay or paper.  For instance exact conventions become unimportant as you can display data in any
way you like.  A good example of this is an early Ada computer that stored
programs as abstract syntax trees and then presented to the programmer
in their preferred format.  This is an alternative approach to formatting all
the code in the same the Black does with Python.
