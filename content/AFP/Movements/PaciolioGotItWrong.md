title: Paciolo got it wrong and why it doesn't matter.

After doing a worked example of trading using normal accounting conventions with graphs and it
 just seem wrong.  Luca Pacioli's wrote the textbook in 1494 {{% ref Pacioli1494 %}} and everyone has copied
 the conventions since.

I think it is wrong rather than just a matter of convention.  There are other good examples in
Science where for instance the electron has a negative charge so the flow of electrons is in the
opposite sent to which current is meant to flow.  The negative charge was discovered in 
[1987 by JJ Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)

I am theorising that there are two problems which lead to this:

- Not using negative numbers
- Starting with a going concern rather than a fresh one

## Negative numbers

The problem comes in the transmission of Hindu mathematics to Italy via the Arabs.  The Hindus had
negative numbers which they used for debts.  Along the way the Hindu/Arabic numerals were
transmitted but negative numbers were dropped. 

The use of negative numbers with the direction gives the graph representation meaning.
Without negative numbers you move in Paciolo's language from shall give `in dare` and
shall receive "in habere" and by "per" and to "a" in the journal.  In the ledger you have the
left and right hand side which substitute for positive and negative numbers.

There is an advantage of separating out the positive and negative numbers in that it becomes easier
to error check your balances.  Making simple errors is very easy.

At least two people who have used graph theory have both swapped the convention as it just
makes more sense.  So perhaps {{% ref kleppmann2011 %}} did it and he just said 
```
Now, by convention, accountants flip the sign on all of the blue and pink nodes’ balances, which means that the two sums end up being equal. And that’s why it’s called a balance sheet.```

## Going concern

I think the reason Paciolo went for his interpretation is that he started with an inventory of a going
concern.  The first movement is cash to equity and once you have made that choice everything has to 
follow. If he had started with an empty balance sheet I think he might have gone in a different
direction.


In the end it becomes a matter of presentation and computers are adept at reformatting and
redisplaying in your own personal choice.  However to think clearly about things in the
next example were rework the orange trading with money
