When I think of money I visualise it as coins in my hands.  However when you
are thinkng about movements between entities, what does it actually mean?
If you are transferring sheep the object being transferred is clear - twenty
six sheep.  However what does the transaction record - is it the debt of 26
sheep or the sheep themselves or is it both?
