Luca Pacioli published the first book on accounting, Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita, in 1494.  I used to think that it mattered that the first book was written by a Ragusian merchant Benedetto Contrugli and that he should have got the credit.

However Pacioli wrote clearly and formalised the practice that had been developed in Renaissance Italy. His exposition is a masterpiece which I have come back to several times.
It is more of a textbook than an invention.  The history of how the Venetians arrived a this point is complex coming from Indian and Arabic sources.
From a business perspective it is vital if a business is make a profit or a loss but conceptually it is just a difference in sign.

The ICAEW has a nice digitised copy of [Pacioli's book.](https://icaew.onlineculture.co.uk/ttp/?id=b2f80d6f-2e46-4cd5-9e8f-ac7a00ef4390&type=book).  Geisjeeck has a good english translation of Pacioli's book which i available at the Internet Archive.

There is a lot in this short book which is a handbook for Renaissance traders and the foundation of current accounting practice but I want to focus on two areas:

- the 4 books of record
- recording of journal entries

## The 4 books of record

The four books are the :

- Inventory
- Memorandum
- Journal
- Ledger

They are described in Geisjeeck translation as :
```
First, we shall speak of commerce in general and its requirements. Immediately
after the Inventory, you need three books to make the work proper and easy. One
is called Memorandum (Memoriale) , the second Journal (Giornale) , and the third
Ledger (Quaderno). Many, on account of their small business, use only the last
two, that is, the journal and the ledger.
```
Although Pacioli counts three books, the inventory is an important part of the
process and the simplest to understand.  In a stock take at the end of a year
it is rare that there is an exact match and some adjustments will be needed.
Constructing the inventory is also the starting point of accounting records.  It
will be a much smaller document than th others.

There is duplication between the books.  The inventory is a point of time record
like a balance sheet.  The memorandum, journal and ledger all cover a period of time.
From any one of the other three books it is possible to reconstruct with a
significant amount of work a ledger and
journal to at least the level of the numerical entries.  So this provides a level of redundancy.
The double entry of items provides for error checking.

Something that is clear is that the memorandum or day book

## Recording of accounting journals

The journal entries record the movement of money from one account to another.
This is covered in more detail in the section on why [Pacioloi was wrong](/afp/movements/pacioliogotitwrong/).
