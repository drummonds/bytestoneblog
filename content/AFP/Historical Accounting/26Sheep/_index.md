I went to the Louvre today and saw this:

From about 10,000 BP to about 6,000 BP [hollow clay bullae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulla_(seal)) were used to [record transactions](https://www.schoyencollection.com/mathematics-collection/pre-literate-counting/bulla-envelope-ms-4632 transactions).
It is likely that the tokens inside represented amounts of livestock and grain.
The whole sealed amount represents a single transaction.  For instance you could
record the number of sheep given to a shepherd and then make sure the same number were returned.

The essential element in the Bulla is that it is an arrangement between 2 parties and shared between them. It is not perfect as it can be verified only at the making of it and of the destruction of it, but it provides a verifiable record without tampering of a quantity.  You can imagine a shepherd returning the agreed number of sheep at the end of a time in a pasture and agreeing the quantities.

This method of counting clay tokens then developed from a physical counting system using tokens to a more abstract method of using clay stamps or Cuneiform enscriptions on Clay tables.
