Al Jabr is the written by Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in the ninth century.
It is the eponymous source of alegbra (Al Jabr) and became a foundational text
to wean Renaissance accountants off of Roman numersl adn replace with Hindu-Arabic numerals. The book is written in Arabic.  Here is a sample equation:

and here is the english equivalent from translation by x:

The important thing to note is the Arabic equation is written left to right and
the English version right to left.  I think that this is a possible explanation for accounting to transfers to be written right to left.
